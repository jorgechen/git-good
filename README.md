# Conventions on Using GitHub

In an engineering team it's important for us to follow a basic set of standards.  In order to maximize our productivity as developers in a team, it's important to use version control (Git) effectively in conjunction with project planning tools (JIRA) and deployment process (GitLab, Travis).

Get good at Git!
